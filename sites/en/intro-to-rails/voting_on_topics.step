  * Just like before, we're creating a new model named "vote"
  * The only thing really different is the integer we added called `topic_id`.
    * `topic_id` is the data we need to draw the line between votes and topics.
  * We didn't generate a full scaffold this time because we aren't
    going to do the full CRUD for votes; they're just going to be
    considered part of topics as-is.

The `rails generate resource` command does something really similar to the `rails generate scaffold` command.
The difference is:

  * The command `rails generate scaffold <scaffold-name>` generates prepopulated
    controllers, views, models and migrations. Also, it hooks up everything together so you
    can easily do CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations without writing any code.
  * The command `rails generate resource <resource-name>` generates empty
    controllers, models and migrations (no views!) so you, the programmer, can later write your own
    code in those files and customize the behaviour of the application for your needs.

Now that you know what is the difference between scaffold and resource, lets continue with the next step.
